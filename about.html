    <h1>Hi There! I'm Anna</h1>
    <p>
        An Indonesian Finance Manager turned UX Designer. Growing up in Singapore and getting my tertiary education in the United States had given me the opportunity to experience different cultures and ways of life. It makes me passionate about travel and to learn more about human behavior, how culture shapes us and makes us who we are. A passion that I carry over to my design, a human centered approach with a touch of culture.
